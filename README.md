# oranchelo-icon-theme-pkgbuild-arch

This repo is a vanilla Arch pkgbuild for [oranchelo icons](
https://github.com/OrancheloTeam/oranchelo-icon-theme) since yaourt is discontinued. 

I'm lazy so I made the name of the repo shorter and easier for me to not hose completely when I clone it down during installations.
